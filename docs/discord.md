# How to link your Minecraft account with the server Discord

On discord, you can send this command to Phoebot in a private message while you
are also logged in to the Minecraft server:
```
!gamenick MacNugget
```

Phoebot will then send you a whisper in game which includes a verification
code.  Take this verification code back to Discord and send another private
message to Phoebot that says:

```
!verify CODE
```

This will link your Discord and Minecraft account so the bot knows how to reach
you in both places.
