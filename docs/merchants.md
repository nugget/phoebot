## Merchant Notifications (beta)

Similar to how you can set up mailbox chests, you can also place a container
and then attach a sign that says "shop" to tell Phoebot that the container is
part of a store you have created.

Once you've done this, Phoebot will notify you whenever another player makes
a purchase from that container.

This is beta functionality and is subject to change as we continue to develop
it.  It works now, but it's not awesome yet.  Thanks for your patience.
