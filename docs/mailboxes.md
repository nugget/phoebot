## Mailboxes and the Phoenixcraft Postal Service

If you let Phoebot know that a specific chest or container is a mailbox for
you, she will notify you in game and on Discord if another player on the server
places any items in your mailbox.  This is all done now via a simple "magic
sign" interface.  You don't need to fuss with coordinates and whispers any
more.

Sinply place a chest, shulker, or barrel someplace in the world.  Make sure
it's positioned and facing exactly the direction you want.

Then, put a sign on the container with the phrase "mailbox" somewhere in the
text of the sign.  Within a few seconds, Phoebot will know that she has
registered your mailbox and you will receive updates whenever another player
leaves you mail.
